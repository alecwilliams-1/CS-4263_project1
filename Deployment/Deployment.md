<b>Deployment</b>

Project has changed to work with Power-Bi so that it will integrate nicely into our database that we created on Azure.
We will still try to make the project interactive with the user so that they will be able to filter and look for the information
that is relevant to them. This will be available online as well as a downloadable file that can be run locally. This file online will still be available even if the user does not have access to Power Bi. Updates to the data can be made on the server side so that it will be updated on the online client. This report will then be downloaded into a separate file for offlien viewing. There should be no dependencies for the online version. The offline file will need the Power Bi desktop, or access to the online Power Bi where the file can then be loaded into a personal workspace.
