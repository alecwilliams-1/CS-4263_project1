<b>Deployment</b>

Project has changed to work with Power-Bi so that it will integrate nicely into our database that we created on Azure.
We will still try to make the project interactive with the user so that they will be able to filter and look for the information
that is relevant to them. This will be available online as well as a downloadable file that can be run locally.
