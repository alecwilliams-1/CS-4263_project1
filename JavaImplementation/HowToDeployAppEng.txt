 Before you start, you need to install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step1: Go to GCP and create a new App Engine project
Step2: Configure your Eclipse IDE. What you need to do is to install Google Cloud Tools for Eclipse from the Eclipse Marketplace. 
       After completing the installation, go ahead and restart your Eclipse IDE.
Step3: Now go to Eclipse IDE and you should be abble to create an App Engine Java Project. For this assignment, I have created a
       Google App Engine Standard Java Project.
       Click File>New>Other>Google App Engine Standard Java Project
       Enter a name for your project and leave the other fields as their defaults.
       Now click >Finish
       You have created your project!!!
Step4: Go back to GCP and copy the project id of the project where you want your application to be deploy into.
Step5: Go back to eclipse, go to appengine-web.xml file and paste <application>?</application>
       ? = your project id.
Step6: Now save your application. You are now ready to deploy your application.
       Right click the project in the Package Explorer and select Deploy to App Engine Standard. In the account 
       box, click Deploy.
       The status of the deployment appears in the Eclipse Console. Once the deployment is completed, a browser 
       window opens and displays the output of your Servlet.
       YOU APPLICATION IS NOW RUNNING ON GOOGLE CLOUD!!!!!
