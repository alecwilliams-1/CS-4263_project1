# Implementation

Our project is a Power Bi representation of the SQL data in our Azure server. We have created graphical interpretations of this
data to allow the user to easily find information. Some of these charts allow you to search through companies to see what political 
leaning their employees have. There is also a graph to show the donation rates per city, and what sectors are more heavily donated
to. This will be available online as well as a downloadable Power Bi file that would have to run through Power Bi Desktop.

The data used in this project was gathered from [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/) where the data is made public for academic use. The data gathered was required to be filtered so that it matched the syntax of a csv file to be put into a SQL database. 

Using Power BI the file is also able to be embeded into a website which is where our project would naturally head towards. The project in the future could also use the full dataset from Open Secrets to get national data on political donations.
