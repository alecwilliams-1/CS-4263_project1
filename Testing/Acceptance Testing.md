This will be where we need to look back at the requirements that were given to us last semester. We will go step by step
through these to make sure that our project fulfills them. Given the somewhat obscure nature of the requirements,
this should not be much of a problem. Our project so far fulfills these requirements except for the visual nature of it.
We hope to have this part done soon as well.
