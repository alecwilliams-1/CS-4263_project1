To begin we will make sure that the application is able to be run natively on a client computer. 
This will need to install the necessary dependencies from python onto the client side.

The only bottleneck could be multiple clients accessing the Azure server at one time. Azure is able to handle
scaling the server to meet demand, but too much traffic could warrant more money being taken to handle it.
