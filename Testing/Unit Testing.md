Our project will ideally have multiple fields where the user can sort the data that is being dispalyed.
We will have multiple tests that could potentially pose problems with the sql code that is being run.
We will also try to run large volumes of queries to the server to see the effect that this might have.
We can also run these on multiple operating systems to make sure that a wide array of users will be able to 
enjoy our software.
